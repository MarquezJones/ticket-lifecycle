<p>
  User Ken creates a ticket:
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John Doe logs in.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign the ticket to a System Administrator.
</p>
<p>
  He makes sure to leave a proper message:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i61WQKi.jpg" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Sys admin agent login"/>
</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works on the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DYPJufr.png" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Working the issue"/>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kRpUysm.png" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Working the issue"/>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  This scenario illustrates the creation of a ticket by a user, the assignment of the ticket, and the communication between agents regarding the ticket, ultimately leading to its resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severity level, or reassigned to a more qualified agent or department to handle the issue, depending on the business impact.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this tutorial helps you understand and provides a better general overview of the life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywhere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depending on the company size.
